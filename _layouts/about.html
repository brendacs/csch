        <p>
            It all started when Kevin and John created the TwitchLearnsProgramming community on Twitch.tv in 2015, where they streamed mock interviews of candidates ranging from first-year university students to senior software engineers. These streams garnered a significant viewer base. Then, the pair created the CS Career Hub (previously CS Career Hackers) Discord community in July of 2017, a more permanent collection of chat rooms designed to serve as a space where learners and experienced engineers alike could connect and discuss career and programming issues.

            Kevin then posted a link to join this community on the r/cscareerquestions subreddit. Within two weeks, over a thousand people had joined this community. From there, we've grown even more and have facilitated mock interviews, discussions on interview and career questions, and a community-wide project. We hope to do so much more in the future. Join our community to learn more!
